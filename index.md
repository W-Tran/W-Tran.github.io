### Uplift modelling for Direct Marketing - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/uplift-modelling)

Who should marketers send promotional offers to in order to retain customers and increase profit? blindly contacting customers could result in the opposite intended effect due to ["sleeping dogs"](http://stochasticsolutions.com/pdf/CrossSell.pdf). This project follows the methodology of a [recent paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmr.16.0163) in order to show the effectiveness of uplift modelling on a popular [marketing dataset](https://blog.minethatdata.com/2008/03/minethatdata-e-mail-analytics-and-data.html). 

### Customer Lifetime Value modelling and Customer Segmentation - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/Online-Retail)

An analysis of a [popular E-commerce dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) which consists of the transaction history for a Uk-based non-store online retail. Use RFM summary statistics combined with a BG/NBD model to forecast the total number of transactions customers will make, as well as the total value of the transactions, in a future period (known as Customer Lifetime Value modelling). Also, using the RFM value of each customer, perform Customer Segmentation to figure out who the best customers are.

### Predicting next purchase day: Discrete Survival Logistic Regression - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/Online-Retail)
In the project above, future customer transactions was forecasted using a BG/NBD model. The model however is unable to predict on exactly which day a customer is likely make a transaction, nor is it able to provide a distribution over the future time period showing the likeliest transaction days. In this project the dataset was reformulated into Discrete Time Events, suitable for fitting a Proportional Hazards model, to perform the aforementioned forecasting.

### (Kaggle) Advanced Regression Techniques - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/advanced-regression-techniques)

A "knowledge" [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) hosted to practice feature engineering and apply advanced regression models like random forests and gradient boosting. Many models were tried but the best performing model found in this project was a simple OLSR using engineered features selected using [Sequential Feature Selection](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/SequentialFeatureSelector/). A simple linear model was ideal as model interpretability was a priority and was discussed at length torwards the end of the project.
