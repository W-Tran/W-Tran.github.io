### Uplift modelling for Direct Marketing - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/uplift-modelling)

Who should marketers send promotional offers to in order to retain customers and increase profit? blindly contacting customers could result in the opposite intended effect due to ["sleeping dogs"](http://stochasticsolutions.com/pdf/CrossSell.pdf). This project follows the methodology of a [recent paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmr.16.0163) in order to show the effectiveness of uplift modelling on a popular [marketing dataset](https://blog.minethatdata.com/2008/03/minethatdata-e-mail-analytics-and-data.html). 

### Customer Lifetime Value modelling and Customer Segmentation - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/online-Retail)

An analysis of a [popular E-commerce dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) which consists of the transaction history for a Uk-based non-store online retail. Use RFM summary statistics to cluster and segment customers based on their transaction history to distinguish between high and low value customers. Evaluate the clustering using the second year of transaction histories.

### Predicting next purchase day: Discrete Survival Logistic Regression - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/predicting-next-purchase)
Using the same online retail data set, produce a classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase within the next month. The model is trained using the pervious month's transactions as labels whilst RFM summary statistics as well as other engineered features are used to train the model.

### (Kaggle) Advanced Regression Techniques - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/advanced-regression-techniques)

A "knowledge" [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) hosted to practice feature engineering and apply advanced regression models like random forests and gradient boosting. Many models were tried but the best performing model found in this project was a simple OLSR using engineered features selected using [Sequential Feature Selection](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/SequentialFeatureSelector/). A simple linear model was ideal as model interpretability was a priority and was discussed at length torwards the end of the project.

### (Kaggle) Home Credit Risk modelling - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/home-credit-default-risk)

A Kaggle competition that was studied and worked through with the guidance of other community member's notebooks. Gained experience with creating and aggregating features from multiple tables within a relational database.
