### Customer Lifetime Value modelling and Customer Segmentation - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/Online-Retail)

An analysis of a [popular E-commerce dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) which consists of the transaction history for a Uk-based non-store online retail. Use **RFM summary statistics** combined with a **BG/NBD model** to forecast the total number of transactions customers will make, as well as the total value of the transactions, in a future period (this is known as **Customer Lifetime Value** modelling in marketing parlance). Also, using the RFM value for each customer, perform **Customer Segmentation** to figure out who the best customers are and briefly discuss some potential marketing strategies to increase revenue going forward.

### Predicting next purchase day (Survival Analysis as a Classification problem)
In the project above, the total number of transactions a customer will make in a future period was forecasting using a BG/NBD model. This model however could not predict when the customer is likely make a transaction, nor is it able to provide a distribution over the future time period showing when the customer is likely to make a transaction. In this project the dataset was reformulated into **Discrete Time Events** and analysed using a **Survival Model** to perform the aforementioned forecasting.

### (Kaggle) Advanced Regression Techniques

A "knowledge" [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) hosted to practice feature engineering and applying advanced regression models like random forests and gradient boosting. Many models were tried but the best performing model found in this project was a simple OLSR using engineered features selected using [Sequential Feature Selection](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/SequentialFeatureSelector/). A simple linear model was ideal as **model interpretability** was a priority and was discussed at length torwards the end of the project.
