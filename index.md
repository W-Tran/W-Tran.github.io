### Customer Segmentation - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/online-Retail)

An analysis of an [E-commerce dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) which consists of the 2 year transaction history of customers for a Uk-based non-store online retail. Compare the performance of clustering customers, based on their 1st year transaction histories, using RFM or simple monetary aggregation features by assessing how well they segment high value customers. The value of customers are determined by their 2nd year residual lifetime value.

### Predicting next purchase month - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/predicting-next-purchase)
Using the same online retail data set, produce a classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase within the next month. The model is trained using the pervious month's transactions as labels whilst RFM as well as other temporal and monetary aggregation features are used to train the model.

### Uplift modelling for Direct Marketing - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/uplift-modelling)

Who should marketers send promotional offers to in order to retain customers and increase profit? blindly contacting customers could result in the opposite intended effect due to ["sleeping dogs"](http://stochasticsolutions.com/pdf/CrossSell.pdf). This project follows the methodology of a [recent paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1509/jmr.16.0163) in order to show the effectiveness of uplift modelling on a popular [marketing dataset](https://blog.minethatdata.com/2008/03/minethatdata-e-mail-analytics-and-data.html). 

### (Kaggle) Advanced Regression Techniques - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/advanced-regression-techniques)

A "knowledge" [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) hosted to practice feature engineering and apply advanced regression models like random forests and gradient boosting. Many models were tried but the best performing model found in this project was a simple OLSR using engineered features selected using [Sequential Feature Selection](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/SequentialFeatureSelector/). A simple linear model was ideal as model interpretability was a priority and was discussed at length torwards the end of the project.   

### (Microsoft DAT102x) Predicting Evictions - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/DAT102x-Predicting-Evictions)

Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science [capstone project](https://datasciencecapstone.org/competitions/12/predicting-evictions/) which ended May 15, 2019. Achieved top 8% on the leaderboard (42/563) using an ensemble of regression models including Random Forests and GBDTs.

### (Kaggle) Home Credit Risk modelling - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/home-credit-default-risk)

A Kaggle competition that was studied and worked through with the guidance of other community member's notebooks. Gained experience with creating and aggregating features from multiple tables within a relational database.

### (Microsoft DAT264x) Identifying Malaria in Blood Imagery - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/DAT264x-identifying-malaria)

Microsoft Professional Program for Artificial Intelligence [capstone project](https://datasciencecapstone.org/competitions/12/predicting-evictions/) which ended June 30, 2019. Achieved top 2% on the leaderboard (11/465) using a 5 model ensemble of DenseNet121s.

### (Udacity) A/B testing by Google - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/ab-testing-udacity)

My summary notes for the [A/B testing Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257) by Google.

### (Stanford) CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (2018) - [link](https://github.com/W-Tran/CS231n-2018)

Completed assignments for the [Spring (2018)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2018/) semester. 

### (Microsoft DAT102x) Predicting Heart Disease Mortality
